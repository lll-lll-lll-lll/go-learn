#### ChatGPT要約
> Sophie Wilson goes on to discuss how advancements in semiconductor technology have allowed for the creation of increasingly powerful microprocessors, with more and more transistors being packed onto a single chip. She explains that as transistor sizes decrease, it becomes more difficult to produce high-quality transistors, which can lead to performance limitations. However, she also notes that new techniques, such as three-dimensional stacking, may allow for continued advancements in microprocessor technology.
Overall, Wilson's talk focuses on the history and future of microprocessors, exploring the technical and economic factors that have driven their development over the past 40 years. She touches on a wide range of topics, from transistor design to manufacturing processes, and provides a broad overview of the field of microprocessor technology.
